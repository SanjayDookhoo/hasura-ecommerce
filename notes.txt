need to run $ hasura seeds apply
    for there to be data in the database

need to change refresh_token to be some string, anything is fine, otherwise would not be able to login 

after logging in as an admin at /admin/account/login (may require doing it again if it fails at first)
    can go to the /admin page to see dashboard stuff

can complete a checkout process with testing data for the credit card 
will need an API key though
